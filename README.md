Misericordia!!!!!!!

this is a hacked mod for Forge 1.12.2, it's in the early stages of development, and 
there are no public builds yet. I'm trying to focus more on the visuals and client GUIs to make it as enjoyable as possible.  

note: i took the base of aurora (an old client made by me) and made some modifications

this have website but is in development: https://halqq.github.io/misericordiasite/
